If you look at the requirements of most lenders, you’ll realize that they almost always ask for a bank account. The good news is that if you don’t have a bank account, you may still get approved for a loan. Lenders who offer short term loans may provide you with the cash you need without a bank account.

Without a bank account, you may get approved for a loan such as a payday loan, title loan, pawnshop loan, or signature loan. With these types of loans, you may get your loan proceeds on a debit card or via cash or a check in the mail.

Keep in mind that these loans usually come with higher APRs and fees than loans that do require a bank account. A bank account may open the doors to more affordable financing options.
