While the terms payday loan and installment loan get used interchangeably, there are noteworthy differences between these two options. A payday loan is a small dollar loan you must pay back on your next payday, usually within a few weeks. You may get approved instantly after you fill out a payday loan application.

An installment loan, on the other hand, is a traditional loan thatâ€™s repaid over time through a series of fixed monthly payments. It may make sense if you need more than a couple hundred bucks and wish to spread your payments out over time.
