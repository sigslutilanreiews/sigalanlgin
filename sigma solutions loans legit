Due to the high interest rate a payday loan often comes with, repayment can be very difficult. If you’re unable to repay your loan on time, you put yourself at risk of accruing additional fees and interest, and facing debt collection activity, a damaged credit score, and even a court summons.

Therefore, if you know it’ll be tough for you to repay it, stay away from a payday loan and opt for a loan product with a lower interest rate. You’re likely to find a loan that will cost you much less, even if you have poor credit.

Unless you’re able to qualify for a payday loan online with a low interest rate, it’s wise to consider the alternative options we’ve mentioned in this article. Websites like MoneyMutual, CashUSA.com, and BadCreditLoans.com can all help you out. Your future self will thank you for choosing another type of loan.
